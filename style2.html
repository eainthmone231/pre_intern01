        <h1>Bridge</h1>
       <p>I like a bridge.Any kinds of bridge at all.A great steel bridge with tower stiff and tall.And old covered bridge that span a waterfall.A huge stone bridge with 
       its rugged floor and wall.A railroad bridge where fright train slowly crawl.A wooden bridge,a cement bridge,whether big or small.Yes I like a bridge.Just any kind of bridge at all</p>
