        <h1>Bridge</h1>
        <p>I like a bridge.<br>Any kinds of bridge at all<br>A great steel bridge with tower stiff and tall<br>And old covered bridge that span a waterfall<br>A huge stone bridge with 
            its rugged floor and wall<br>A railroad bridge where fright train slowly crawl<br>A wooden bridge,a cement bridge,whether big or small<br>Yes I like a bridge<br>Just any kind of bridge at all</p>
